# VALERIE
MARVEL is an R package developed for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution. It complements existing genome browser to enable visualising large number of samples (cells) and large number of splicing events typical of single-cell splicing experiments.

# Version control
**1.x.x**  
The pioneer version.  

**2.0.0**  
Previously, user can specify more than 1 splicing event to plot at a time. Now, user will specify only 1 splicing event to plot at a time. This will increase the speed of reading in the BAM files and also reduce the complexity of the internal codes.  

**2.0.1**  
(1) Anderson-darling added as an option for statistical testing of PSI values at each nucleotide position. User can activate this option by specifying "ad" for the _method_ argument.  
(2) Included a feature to track the progress of reading in the BAM files, which is the rate-limiting step of VALERIE. Hence, user can estimate the time of completion for plotting a given splicing event. User can activate this feature by specifying _TRUE_ for the _track_ argument.  
(3)  Previously, an adjusted p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Now, user can customise this threshold using the _sig.pval_ argument.

**2.1.1**  
(1) DTS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01360.pdf) added as an option for statistical testing of PSI values at each nucleotide position. User can activate this option by specifying "dts" for the _method_ argument.  

**2.1.2**  
(1) Fixed bugs related to cell group and cell group color matching.
(2) Included option (_show.mean.ci=FALSE_) to not show 95% confidence interval for mean PSI plot. Default _show.mean.ci=TRUE_
